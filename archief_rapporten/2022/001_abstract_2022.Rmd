The European eel population (Anguilla anguilla L.) has declined significantly over the past decades and is now considered one of the most endangered fish species in Europe. A key factor contributing to this decline is the restriction of upstream migration of glass eels. In Flanders, the main entry routes for glass eels are the IJzer estuary in Nieuwpoort, the "Sas Slijkens" sluice complex at the mouth of the Ghent-Ostend Canal, and the drainage complex in Zeebrugge at the mouth of the Afleidingskanaal van de Leie (AKL) and the Leopoldkanaal (LK).

Previous research has focused on glass eel migration and possible mitigation measures at the sluicing structures of the Ganzepoot (IJzer estuary), Sas Slijkens (KGO), and the drainage complex in Zeebrugge. This research showed that slightly opening the sluice gate during the incoming tide is an effective and cost-efficient measure to improve the upstream migration of glass eels without causing salinization of the polders due to seawater inflow.

In 2015, no adjusted tidal barrier management was applied at any of these critical locations. Nevertheless, increased electrical conductivity values were measured during that year. These measurements showed that conductivity was regularly elevated at various locations, particularly near the drainage structures and further upstream. Possible causes included site-specific management practices or natural salinization, especially during drier periods with reduced discharge.

Between 2016 and 2022, adjusted tidal barrier management was implemented and evaluated. In 2022, this management continued from March 1 to May 15. Its application varied per watercourse, partly due to differences in target water levels and time windows for sluicing. Additionally, staffing played a role: at the IJzer (Ganzepoot), permanent personnel from inland navigation support allowed sluicing management to be carried out outside regular office hours, including at night. In contrast, such flexibility was not available at the drainage structures of the AKL and LK.

Previous studies indicated that opportunities to increase eel density in the LK remained underutilized [@Steendam2019], as adjusted tidal barrage management in Zeebrugge (LK and AKL) was applied to a lesser extent compared to other watercourses such as the Ghent-Ostend Canal and the IJzer. To address this, an attempt was made in 2021 to enhance adjusted tidal barrage management in the LK by keeping the sluice gates open during the outgoing tide as well, allowing adapted sluicing twice per 24 hours. On March 3, 2021, glass eels were allowed into the LK for the first time, and the sluice gates remained open continuously until March 9. However, this led to high salinity levels, prompting a temporary suspension of adjusted tidal barrage management from March 10 to March 18. From March 19 onward, sluicing management was resumed but only during the daytime, as in previous years. In 2022, the original management approach was reinstated, with the sluice gates opening only during the day.
